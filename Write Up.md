# Creating Business Manuals for Automatic Business
##### A write up of a presentation given by Jaydin Andrews as a Professional Development Seminar for the Weaverville Bussiness Association on February 7th, 2024.

## Thought Experiment
However, before we delve into the how and why, let's start with a thought experiment. Imagine, just for a moment, that you couldn't make it to your place of business for a few days, or even a few months. Maybe you're finally taking your well-earned and highly coveted day off. Or perhaps you're attending a family event or tending to a personal emergency. Or you're sick or injured. Whatever it may be, you're incommunicado from all work-related ordeals.

Now I want you to answer a question: What would your employees / team be able to do in your absence?

Maybe you’ll find it easier to answer more set of more specific questions:
- Would they know how to open and close your place business?
- How about taking special orders, closing a sale on account, or placing an order with a vendor?
- Would they be able to get in contact with your payroll accountant? Your insurance agent? What about your attorney?
- How would they handle getting hurt while on the clock? Or even worse, would they know how to handle a customer injury?

Surely, not all of these examples might directly apply to your business. However, the fact remains that as CEOs, Owners, Presidents, you certainly juggle diverse roles. Thus, the question arises, "How straightforward (or incredibly challenging) would it be for someone else to take on one of those roles, even briefly?”

The more that we think about this hypothetical, we begin to notice two core problems: an inaccessibility of critical information, and the absence of contingency planning. Lets define each of these problems a little more to better understand the scope of these pitfalls.

### Inaccessible Knowledge

As your business grows, so does your knowledge and expertise. You learn what procedures and operations work for you. You develop a routine of how you and your team like operate. While this organic growth is incredibly exciting, it begins to fall apart as you begin to invite more people into the fold. This expertise might be second nature to you, but to an outsider (like a new hire perhaps) it could easily appear as poor management. You’re processes become reactive rather than proactive.

### Lack of Contingencies

### Defining a Solution

Now that we’ve identifies our problems, what would an ideal solution have to address?

For starters, we need to make critical information easy to access. Centralizing that knowledge is the first step, but even a pile of papers or massive folder of unorganized documents is difficult to maneuver. The information needs to be organized and structured so that retrieval and enactment is intuitive.

### A Default yet Imperfect Solution

In a corporate environment, the ideal solution typically involves three distinct categories of documents. First, an Employee Handbook, which outlines the company's mission, values, culture, policies, and expected behaviors. Second, a Business Continuity Plan, which is essentially a comprehensive strategy and system designed to minimize or swiftly recover from major operational disruptions – Google's strategy to maintain service during a regional blackout serves as a prime example. Lastly, the third category would cover Standard Operating Procedures specific to individual departments, teams, and roles.

Despite their importance, the complexity and legal jargon often found in these corporate documents can be daunting for small businesses. Employee Handbooks, for instance, are typically rigid and have a one-size-fits-all approach that might not be suitable for smaller teams. Similarly, Business Continuity Plans are designed for larger operations and might contain irrelevant details for smaller businesses. Lastly, specialized Standard Operating Procedures are tailored for distinct roles, which might not be applicable for entrepreneurs who wear multiple hats.

### The Ideal Solution

What would it look like if we took the principles of our over engineered corporate solution and tailored them specifically to your small business?

### Enacting the Plan

1. Start by noting your daily process; or better yet, ask your team what (and how) they do on daily basis
2. Document those steps as you preform them; its okay if the pages are not organized, we’ll get to that
3. Test those SOP’s as if you were a new employee or a stranger to the business
4. Organize your information is systematic fashion
